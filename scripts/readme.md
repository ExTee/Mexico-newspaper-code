# DataFrame Structures

For our tasks, we've developed some standardized DataFrame structures to facilitate re-use.

It is encouraged to re-format any new data into the same structures.

## Input Standard DataFrame

`data/processed/input_standard_dataframe.pkl`

- `date`: Date of publishing
- `title`: Article title
- `byline`: Author of article
- `section`: Section and page of newspaper
- `length`: number of words in article
- k fields where k is the number of agencies or groups. Each field is a binary variable consisting of 0 or 1, 1 indicating that article mentions agency.
- `agencies`: array of all agencies mentioned by an article
- `story_sentences`: array of sentences of article
- `num_sentences`: number of sentences
- `story_sentence_index`: sentence index where an agency is mentioned

## Article Sentiment Standard Dataframe

This dataframe is the same as the Input Standard Dataframe, but with a few columns added.
